**Advantages:**

:+1: SOTA on all 3D facial alignment, face orientation estimation, and 3D face modeling.<br><br>
:+1: Fast inference with 3000fps on a laptop RTX 2080.<br><br>
:+1: Simple implementation with only widely used operations.<br><br>

(This project is built/tested on Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.9)

**Single Image Inference Demo**
1. Clone

    ```git clone https://github.com/choyingw/SynergyNet```

    ```cd SynergyNet ```

2. Use conda

    ```conda create --name SynergyNet```

    ```conda activate SynergyNet```

3. Install pre-requisite common packages

    ```PyTorch 1.9 (should also be compatiable with 1.0+ versions), Opencv, Scipy, Matplotlib ```

4. Download data [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YVBRcXmCeO1t5Bepv67KVr_QKcOur3Yy/view?usp=sharing">here</a>] and
[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQsMhvAmpD1O8Hm0yEGom0C0rXtA0qs8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>]. Extract these data under the repo root.

These data are processed from [<a href="https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA">3DDFA</a>] and [<a href="https://github.com/shamangary/FSA-Net">FSA-Net</a>].

Download pretrained weights [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVHbiLTfX6iTeJcNbh-jgHjWDoemfrzG/view?usp=sharing">here</a>]. Put the model under 'pretrained/'

5. Compile Sim3DR and FaceBoxes:

    ```cd Sim3DR```

    ```./build_sim3dr.sh```

    ```cd ../FaceBoxes```

    ```./build_cpu_nms.sh```

    ```cd ..```

5. Inference

    ```python singleImage.py -f img```

**Evaluation**

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-4

2. Benchmarking

    ```python benchmark.py -w pretrained/best.pth.tar```

Print-out results and visualization under 'results/' (see 'demo/' for some sample references) are shown.

**Training**

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-4.

2. Download training data from [<a href="https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA">3DDFA</a>]: train_aug_120x120.zip and extract the zip file under the root folder (Containing about 680K images).

3. 
    ```bash train_script.sh```

4. Please refer to train_script for hyperparameters, such as learning rate, epochs, or GPU device. The default settings take ~19G on a 3090 GPU and about 6 hours for training. If your GPU is less than this size, please decrease the batch size and learning rate proportionally.

**Textured Artistic Face Meshes**

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-5.

2. Download artistic faces data [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYR5aqSCUGnggjhTbwU4vEwHxV1xq9ko/view?usp=sharing">here</a>], which are from [<a href="https://faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/site/foa/artistic-faces-dataset.asp">AF-Dataset</a>]. Download our inferred UV maps [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TWJiitXAfZD_AwoJLw58XBPgOdanqgcG/view?usp=sharing">here</a>] by UV-texture GAN. Extract them under the root folder.

3.
    ```python artistic.py -f art-all/122.png```

Note that this artistic face dataset contains many different level/style face abstration. If a testing image is close to real, the result is much better than those of highly abstract samples.  


We show a comparison with [<a href="https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA">DECA</a>] using the top-3 largest roll angle samples in AFLW2000-3D.
