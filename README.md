## <div align="center"> Advantages</div>

:+1: SOTA on all 3D facial alignment, face orientation estimation, and 3D face modeling.<br><br>
:+1: Fast inference with 3000fps on a laptop RTX 2080.<br><br>
:+1: Simple implementation with only widely used operations.<br><br>

(This project is built/tested on Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.9 on a compatible GPU)

## <div align="center"> Single Image Inference Demo</div>

1. Clone

    ```git clone https://github.com/choyingw/SynergyNet```

    ```cd SynergyNet ```

2. Use conda

    ```conda create --name SynergyNet```

    ```conda activate SynergyNet```

3. Install pre-requisite common packages

    ```PyTorch 1.9 (should also be compatiable with 1.0+ versions), Torchvision, Opencv, Scipy, Matplotlib, Cython ```

4. Download data [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YVBRcXmCeO1t5Bepv67KVr_QKcOur3Yy/view?usp=sharing">here</a>] and
[<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQsMhvAmpD1O8Hm0yEGom0C0rXtA0qs8/view?usp=sharing">here</a>]. Extract these data under the repo root.

These data are processed from [<a href="https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA">3DDFA</a>] and [<a href="https://github.com/shamangary/FSA-Net">FSA-Net</a>].

Download pretrained weights [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVHbiLTfX6iTeJcNbh-jgHjWDoemfrzG/view?usp=sharing">here</a>]. Put the model under 'pretrained/'

5. Compile Sim3DR and FaceBoxes:

    ```cd Sim3DR```

    ```./build_sim3dr.sh```

    ```cd ../FaceBoxes```

    ```./build_cpu_nms.sh```

    ```cd ..```

6. Inference

    ```python singleImage.py -f img```

The default inference requires a compatible GPU to run. If you would like to run on a CPU, please comment the .cuda() and load the pretrained weights into cpu.

## <div align="center"> Simplified API</div>

We provide a simple API for convenient usage if you want to plug in this method into your work.

```python
import cv2
from synergy3DMM import SynergyNet
model = SynergyNet()
I = cv2.imread(<your image path>)
# get landmark [[y, x, z], 68 (points)], mesh [[y, x, z], 53215 (points)], and face pose (Euler angles [yaw, pitch, roll] and translation [y, x, z])
lmk3d, mesh, pose = model.get_all_outputs(I)
```
We provide a simple script in singleImage_simple.py

We also provide a setup.py file. Run <code>pip install -e . </code> You can do <code>from synergy3DMM import SynergyNet</code> in other directory. Note that [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SQsMhvAmpD1O8Hm0yEGom0C0rXtA0qs8/view?usp=sharing">3dmm_data</a>] and [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVHbiLTfX6iTeJcNbh-jgHjWDoemfrzG/view?usp=sharing">pretrained weight</a>] (Put the model under 'pretrained/') need to be present.

## <div align="center">Benchmark Evaluation</div>

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-4

2. Benchmarking

    ```python benchmark.py -w pretrained/best.pth.tar```

Print-out results and visualization fo first-50 examples are stored under 'results/' (see 'demo/' for some pre-generated samples as references) are shown.

Updates: Best head pose estimation [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XN74PIMWDue1UNJuDJd16BH8fvZpfwDp/view?usp=sharing">pretrained model</a>]  (Mean MAE: 3.31) that is better than number reported in paper (3.35). Use -w to load different pretrained models.

## <div align="center">Training</div>

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-4.

2. Download training data from [<a href="https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA">3DDFA</a>]: train_aug_120x120.zip and extract the zip file under the root folder (Containing about 680K images).

3. 
    ```bash train_script.sh```

4. Please refer to train_script for hyperparameters, such as learning rate, epochs, or GPU device. The default settings take ~19G on a 3090 GPU and about 6 hours for training. If your GPU is less than this size, please decrease the batch size and learning rate proportionally.

## <div align="center">Textured Artistic Face Meshes</div>

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-5.

2. Download artistic faces data [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yYR5aqSCUGnggjhTbwU4vEwHxV1xq9ko/view?usp=sharing">here</a>], which are from [<a href="https://faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/site/foa/artistic-faces-dataset.asp">AF-Dataset</a>]. Download our predicted UV maps [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TWJiitXAfZD_AwoJLw58XBPgOdanqgcG/view?usp=sharing">here</a>] by UV-texture GAN. Extract them under the root folder.

3.
    ```python artistic.py -f art-all --png```(whole folder)
    
    ```python artistic.py -f art-all/122.png```(single image)
    

Note that this artistic face dataset contains many different level/style face abstration. If a testing image is close to real, the result is much better than those of highly abstract samples. 

## <div align="center">Textured Real Face Renderings</div>

1. Follow Single Image Inference Demo: Step 1-5.

2. Download our predicted UV maps and real face images for AFLW2000-3D [<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12QCzkzBCKIEA3DSn6Kx5seeCeoUXKISc/view?usp=sharing">here</a>] by UV-texture GAN. Extract them under the root folder.

3.
    ```python uv_texture_realFaces.py -f texture_data/real --png``` (whole folder)

    ```python uv_texture_realFaces.py -f texture_data/real/image00002_real_A.png``` (single image) 

The results (3D meshes and renderings) are stored under 'inference_output'

## <div align="center">Training UV-texture GAN</div>

1. Acquire AFLW2000-3D dataset and use [<a href="https://github.com/jiaxiangshang/MGCNet/tree/master">MGC-Net</a>] test pipeline to get UV-texture for the AFLW2000 images.

2. Use [<a href="https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix">Pix2Pix</a>] and train LSGAN with un-paired loss by their training recipe. In the input layer, concat the mean UV-texture and image and also shortcut add the mean texture at the output of generator.

3. The mean UV-texture can be got from original BFM set or from [<a href="https://github.com/yfeng95/face3d/blob/master/examples/Data/uv_texture_map.jpg">face3d</a>]

## <div align="center">More Results</div>

We show a comparison with [<a href="https://github.com/YadiraF/DECA">DECA</a>] using the top-3 largest roll angle samples in AFLW2000-3D.
